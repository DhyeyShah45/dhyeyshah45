## 🧑‍💻 About Me  

- 💡 Backend-focused developer, fluent in **JavaScript/TypeScript**.  
- 🌐 I enjoy exploring **cloud, infra, and system design** (because code is only half the battle).  
- 🔎 I’m curious about **how things work under the hood** — from Node’s Architecture to AWS EC2 Hypervisor internals.  
- 📚 Currently learning **Kafka** and diving deeper into **distributed systems**.  
- 🌱 Outside of code, I think a lot about **scalability — in tech and in life**.
- ☁️ AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, with hands-on experience designing scalable infra.

## 🌌 Current Focus  

- ⚡ Mastering **Kafka & event-driven architectures**  
- 🕸️ Understanding **distributed systems** & trade-offs  
- 🛠️ Polishing my open-source package [request-context-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-context-logger), 
a simple request-scoped logger built with AsyncLocalStorage.

## 🎨 Theme  

- **🔍 Curious by nature** – I dig into internals instead of treating tools as black boxes.  
- **⚙️ Systems over features** – I think about pipelines, flows, and infra beyond just coding.  
- **🌍 Builder mindset** – I like connecting small components into something scalable & useful.
